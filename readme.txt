Open Educational Resource (OER) management and curation, metadata publishing, and alignment to Common Core State Standards.

== Description ==
WP OER is a free plugin which allows you to create your own open educational resource repository on any WordPress website. Why pay for a proprietary system with limited options? WP OER is customizable, easy to use, and free.

Open Educational Resources (OER) are freely accessible, openly licensed documents and media useful for teaching, learning, and assessing as well as for research purposes.

Alternative and more flexible licensing options have become available as a result of the work of Creative Commons, an organization providing ready-made licensing agreements less restrictive than the "all rights reserved" terms of standard international copyright. These new options have become a "critical infrastructure service for the OER movement." Another license, typically used by developers of OER software, is the GNU General Public License from the free and open-source software (FOSS) community.

More information about Open Education and the U.S. Department of Education's #GoOpen campaign can be found on the Office of Educational Technology's website.
